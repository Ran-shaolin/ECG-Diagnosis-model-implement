# ECG-Diagnosis-model-implement
In the software file, there are three files for ECG diagnois, including "Large_scale_model_train", "Pruning" and "Quantization". The files in the "Large_scale_model_train" are used for original ECG diagnosis model training. The files in the "Pruning" are used for model pruning and finetune. The files in the "Quantization" are used for model quantization and finetune to recover the model performance.

In the hardware file, 

In the Hardware file, there is one file named accelerator design, which include the codes for reconfigurable accelerator written by C++.
