# ECG-Diagnosis-model-implement
In the software file, there are three files for ECG diagnois, including "Large_scale_model_train", "Pruning" and "Quantization". The files in the "Large_scale_model_train" are used for original ECG diagnosis model training. The files in the "Pruning" are used for model pruning and finetune. The files in the "Quantization" are used for model quantization and finetune to recover the model performance.

In the hardware file, there is one file named accelerator design, which include the codes for reconfigurable accelerator written by C++. The "ecg_tb.cpp" file is used for the accelerator code test in the Xilinx HLS software. The project, which we have established in the HLS, are compressed in the "HLS project.rar". One can directly decompress the rar package and run it in the Xilinx software.
